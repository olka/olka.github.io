      <description>Preface Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve got interesting task related to random data generation and writing this data on disk as fast as possible using Java. Unfortunately performance requirements were really tight: in peak application should support writing at ~3 Gb/s. Which means that it should generate random data at really high pace, encode it to proper charset and finally write to disk. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty much an exposition and motivation behind following measurements and why it was so important to dig in.</description>
